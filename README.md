# grahampugh-recipes

A few recipes not found elsewhere. To use them, enter the following command:

```
autopkg repo-add grahampugh/recipes
```

## What are all these yaml files?

I am starting to write my recipes as `yaml` files, and then convert them to `plist` format when I'm done. I find constructing the recipes much nicer in `yaml` format. You can safely ignore the `yaml` files if you wish.

If you wish to do the same, take a look at https://github.com/grahampugh/plist-yaml-plist
